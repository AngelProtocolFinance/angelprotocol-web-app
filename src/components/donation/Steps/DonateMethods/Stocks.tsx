        Benefits of Donating Appreciated stock
      </h4>
      <p>
        You can enjoy significant tax advantages and maximize the size of your
        contributions when you transfer securities through Better.Giving:
      </p>
      <div className="grid rounded bg-gray-l5 dark:bg-bluegray-d1 p-2">
        <span className="text-sm text-gray">
          NOTE: This is not financial advice! Please speak to your tax advisor
          or broker about your specific situation and country's tax laws.
        </span>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you held the stock for at least one year, you receive a tax deduction
        for the full value of the stock at the time of donation (not just the
        amount you paid for the stock).
      </p>
      <p>
        You avoid paying both capital gains tax and stock sales commissions.
        When you give appreciated stocks directly to a nonprofit, your gift can
        be up to 20% larger because you avoid the taxes you'd incur from selling
        and donating the cash.
