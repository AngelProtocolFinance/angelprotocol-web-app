    paragraphs: [
      <p>
        Yes, Better Giving’s fundraising solutions and donation processing are
        completely free: we grant out 100% of all donations, and you pay no
        costs at any time. We rely on optional donor contributions during
        checkout for support, allowing us to provide free services to nonprofits
        while remaining sustainable. We believe in nonprofit optionality, and
        you may opt out of this donor contribution model in favor of a 1.5%
        platform fee if you prefer.

        Better Giving takes care of all the heavy lifting when it comes to tax

    paragraphs: [
      <p>
        Our high-yield savings account provides a secure, low-risk way for
        nonprofits to grow their donations. Donated funds are automatically
        placed in a US Treasury yield money market account with Fidelity
        Investments to earn steady interest as soon as possible, helping you
        build financial stability without risking your principal. As a nonprofit
        ourselves, we use the same savings services to manage our own funds,
        ensuring reliability and trust.

    question:
      "How do the managed investment funds work, and how do they benefit nonprofits?",
    paragraphs: [
      <p>
        Our flagship Sustainability Fund is a high-yield investment fund
        averaging 24% returns annually over the past five years. It’s designed
        to help nonprofits achieve long-term financial stability by growing
        their donations over time. Unlike one-time donations that are used up
        quickly, the Sustainability Fund allows your contributions to keep
        working for your organization. The growth is reinvested until you
        request funds granted out, ensuring your nonprofit has a reliable source
        of funding well into the future.

        your fund performance, including the growth of your savings account and

        0.8% AUM fee, with a 12.5% performance fee over 5% returns: we only win
