          At Better Giving, we recognize that many grassroots organizations,
          especially those outside the US, struggle to access IRS tax-exempt
          status and benefit from US donor support. Our fiscal sponsorship
          program helps bridge this gap, allowing these organizations to receive
          tax-deductible donations while we handle the legal and tax
          complexities for them.
