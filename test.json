      "charity_overview": "The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation (formerly Philippine Funds for Little Kids) began from a single social media post, “wow…kids swim 2km to school!!!”, after being told and eventually witnessing the determination of the children in the mangrove village of Layag-Layag, Brgy. Talon-Talon, Zamboanga City to go to school.\n\nAware of the dangers on their path to acquire education, these children tirelessly swim across bodies of water and walk several kilometers through sand and mud with the hope of someday changing the lives of their families into something better.\n\nAs a response, we decided to start a fundraising effort and pooled our resources to fund the Yellow Boat Project to help these children get to school fast, safe, and dry.\n\nWhat we initially thought was a one-time project turned out to be our life-long mission.\n\nWe believe that education is the only way and hope of these children and their families to escape poverty. If kids can keep going to school, things can change.\n\nWith the help of our partners, Hope Paddlers, and volunteers, our Yellow Boat Project has snowballed into a much bigger advocacy to effect lasting changes and improvement to the lives of the communities.\n\nFrom one humble yellow boat with the words “Bagong Pag-Asa” (New Hope) imprinted on its body, we are now building classrooms, dormitories, bridges, and community learning centers;and also providing scholarships, school supplies, and medical and dental missions.\n\nWe conduct feeding programs as well to make it easier for kids to stay in school, and livelihood projects to help parents sustain their kids’ education.\n\nOur Yellow Boat Project has sailed countless journeys, touched many lives, and continues to ferry thousands of children to school every day to pave a brighter future for them. Furthermore, we have created more initiatives to uplift the lives of entire communities. These are the Yellow School Boat Project, Adopt-a-Fisherman Project, Yellow School of Hope, Yellow Dorm of Hope, Yellow Boat ALS Karunungan, Yellow Boat Adventures, Yellow Bridge of Hope, Week Without Walls, Yellow Boat E-Hubs, and Seeds of Hope among others.\n\nAmazingly, with the help of the Almighty, our sponsors, and the unwavering volunteerism of our Hope Paddlers, we continue to bring “Bagong Pag-Asa” to where it is needed.\n\nWe can get there faster if we all work together and help each other. No amount of donation or effort is too small to make a change… because it only takes one person who cares to make a difference.\n\nCome paddle with us until no kid is left behind… one Yellow Boat at a time. #HopeSails",

Students typically participate 5 days per week, including 2 days of girls and boys soccer practices, 2 days of enrichment classes (poetry or civic leadership), and a soccer game day in which teams play other Scores teams.

Students typically participate in activities 3-5 days per week.

While soccer is generally played across economic classes internationally, the sport is dominated by a “pay to play” model in the United States, requiring considerable financial contributions to cover equipment costs, travel expenses, club fees, and much more. Play equity gaps lead to health equity gaps and systemic barriers to joining high quality teams and leagues deprive our society of a vast resource of youth talent. \n\nAt Boston Scores, students can join a free soccer team at their school. After their soccer practices, students move with their teammates from the field to the classroom, where they engage in hands-on curricula that connect to their real-world experiences. They emerge empowered to make positive changes in their lives and in their communities.",
