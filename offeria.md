Rationale
Brand name
Replace every visible use of “Better Giving” with Offeria. (Keep “Better Giving” only in T&Cs: “Offeria is a d/b/a of Better Giving Inc.”)
Catholic brand identity separation.
Audience nouns
Replace “nonprofits / organizations” → Catholic organizations, parishes, schools, dioceses, and ministries (depending on context).
Faith-specific clarity.
Giving language
Replace “donations / fundraising / campaigns” → gifts / giving / stewardship / appeals (interchangeably).
Mirrors parish bulletin style.
Visual tone
Update imagery from abstract illustrations → photo-first (reverent parish life: sacraments, community, service).
Better fit for older Catholic audience.
Faith alignment band
Add short line near Savings/Fund references: “All investment options follow Catholic investing guidelines informed by the USCCB Socially Responsible Investment Guidelines.”
Required distinction for Catholic audience.

Intro paragraph
 Stewardship isn’t a program—it’s how we walk together in mission.
 As a nonprofit rooted in faith, Offeria welcomes every registered parish, school, diocese, and ministry into a shared community of good stewardship—built on trust, transparency, and shared growth.
Tab 1: Your Rights
The Offeria Covenant — your three rights:
Financial Stewardship: access savings and investment options that help your parish grow lasting reserves in accordance with Catholic values.


Fair Access: equal access to modern giving tools—regardless of parish size, budget, or location.


Faithful Autonomy: freedom to direct and manage your funds with transparency and integrity.
Tab 2: Your Benefits
Member Benefits (always included):
White-glove embed help (real people, fast setup)


Automated receipts & reporting


Educational webinars on giving, stewardship, and sustainability


Priority support for parishes and dioceses with special appeals or campaigns


Regular stories and resources you can share with your parish community


(All available free—funded by optional donor infrastructure gifts.)
Tab 3: Your Part
Our shared mission depends on you.
Because Offeria is a nonprofit serving the Church, we rely on our members to help the mission grow. Your part is simple but powerful:
Share Offeria with nearby parishes, schools, and dioceses.


Witness to good stewardship—show others what faithful giving can do.


Stay connected through updates and occasional success stories.


Together we’re helping the Church strengthen financial stewardship, one parish at a time.
