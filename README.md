# angelprotocol-web-app

## GETTING STARTED

### Requirements

- `bun` (1.x) - https://bun.sh/

Install dependencies

```shell
bun install
```

Lastly, we have provided an example `.env` file as `.env.template`.
You'll need to copy this file to `.env` and then modify/add your relevant app's settings, API Keys and the like:

```shell
cp .env.template .env
```

To run the web app server locally, simply execute:

```shell
bun start
```
